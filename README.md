# obsidian-digital-garden-proxy
This functions as a proxy for an obsidian "digital garden" hosted on a separate address as this system of sharing notes couldn't be secured in any way. This adds a level of security allowing unique links with tokens to be given with expiry dates and optional telegram oauth authenticaion. It will inject a warning message over the page with the expiry date and uses telegram oauth together with Deta.space object storage and netlify serverless functions to provide a secure authentication system.

This said, this project should work for any domain. Just set the domain in the object storage and this will function as a secure proxy to any domain you chose. All scripts, stylesheets, images, videos, and subpages will all be proxied through the netlify serverless functions and stripped of any metadata referring to the original domain. It will also work for multiple different addresses - it will host whichever address is specified on the supplied token in the object storage.

When setting up the server for the obsidian "digital garden" itself be sure to whitelist only the IP address of this proxy server to prevent it from being directly accessed if one is to know the original address. That said, this proxy is designed to hide the original address entirely and should rewrite and redirect all internal links and scripts on the page through itself
